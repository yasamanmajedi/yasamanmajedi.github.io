I recently completed my undergraduate studies in Computer Engineering at the Sharif University of Technology - Kish International Campus. My research interest lies at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction, Recommender Systems, and Machine Learning. I am primarily interested in working on interdisciplinary research projects solving real-world problems.
